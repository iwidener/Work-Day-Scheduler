AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.

This is a daily planner for the people who like to plan and schedule their day. 

Here is a description of this planner:
* the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar;
* the timeblocks are for standard business hours (from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM);
* each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past(grey), present(red) or future(green);
* an event can be entered into a timeblock;
* when the save button for that timeblock is clicked, an event is saved in local storage;
* when the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.
